Since Angular 2 is not really in a usable state yet I propose that we use Angular 1 for now with
the intention of moving to Angular 2 when it is ready.

To help with facilitation as much as possible now (pre ng-upgrade) I think the most important thing
we can do is to not use controllers and use directives and services only [services not factories]
(http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/10/24/upgrading-apps-to-angular-2-using-ngupgrade.html).

I'm not really a fan of es6/typescript yet and I fucking hate babel and transpiling code, but I'm
actually open to it.
